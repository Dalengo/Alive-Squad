<h3> Introduction </h3>
Alive squad is a 2D platform game on PC. You can move in all directions and jump. 
The goal of the game is to get to the top of the map to kill the boss and finish the level. 
On your way you will encounter several obstacles. There will be enemies. These enemies can inflict damage and kill you. 

<h3> Ennemies </h3>
Green monsters simply move between two points and inflict damage on you if you hit them. To kill them you have to jump on them. 
Purple enemies shoot balls in your direction. Be careful to kill them you must not jump when he shoots otherwise you will take damage. 
Orange enemies are suicide bombers. If you enter their range they will start following you to kill you. If you move far enough away they will stop following you. 
Finally, the boss of each level has several life points. You cannot attack it multiple times in a row while it is flashing red. 

<h3> Trap </h3>
There are also traps. The bombs go off when you approach them and kill you if you are within the blast radius. 
Be careful not to fall on the spikes otherwise you will take damage. 
The most dangerous trap is the turret. It fires rockets in your direction if you are within its range. 
The game also has a multiplayer feature. The concept remains exactly the same except that you can play with your friends.

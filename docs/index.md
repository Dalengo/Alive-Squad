Alive Squad is developed by Cl√©ment Cotte, Matis Lima Barros, Ange Mercoyrol--Dol and Yanis Martin.
    
<h3> Story </h3>

The story begins when a group of astronauts leave the overpopulated Earth in order to find a new habitable planet. Their ship being damaged by a storm of asteroids, they crash on a planet, Zuri. But when trying to get out of the ship, they slip to the bottom of a crevasse. The majority of the crew gets captured by a mysterious species living on this planet. 

Alone, Philippe avoids being captured but found at the bottom of a cave. His goal is simple, free his comrades and find a way to repair the ship to return to Earth.

<h3> Gameplay </h3>

It is a platform game where the character must arrive at the end of each
level by jumping from platform to platform as quickly as possible. The objective will be
to go up from floor to floor until the arrival. The player will interact with his environment,
and will for example have to avoid being detected by enemies. The games will be
in the form of levels, which will be unlockable by completing the previous level. 

Each level will have its particularity and will be unique. The game will get harder and harder level by
level. The player will discover the mechanics of the game as they go. You will have to be precise
and fast while on the move so you don't fall off and get lost.

<h3> Game Style </h3>
Alive Squad is inspired by the famous video games Doodle Jump, Getting
Over It or Jump King. These three games have one thing in common, like Alive Squad, they have a
easy to understand concept however Doodle Jump is a game rather made for parties
fast and is easy unlike the other two which are complicated games, frustrating and
long. Alive Squad is a mix of both.
